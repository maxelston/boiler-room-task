# Boiler Room Task

Node server and React web app showing my three favourite Boiler Room sets.

## Installation

Open Terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maxelston/boiler-room-task.git
```
Navigate to boilerroom-task-maxelston/boilerroom-server then run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ node app
```
If the server is running correctly you should see the following message:

```bash
$ server on port 4000
```
Open a new terminal window and navigate to boilerroom-task-maxelston/boilerroom-client, then run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The React app should then open.
## Notes
Express used on the backend and Material-UI on the front end.
